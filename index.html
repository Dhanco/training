	        <p>This is a sample webpage designed for basic html use with github. It's purpose is to demonstrate how a page would display in github as well as to go over some basic features.</p>

	        <p>Github cannot be summarized in a webpage as it is more of a hosting/collaboration type of software to me as opposed to a web programming tool.</p>
	        <p>The main features of Github are primarily the fact that it allows you to upload and clone copies of a website or other project you are working on to work on them individually and merge editted work together. This page was created in Github and was worked on in a cloned version of the master site before being merged with the master copy.</p>
	        <p>Github allows you to code in your browser if you wish and inside of the Github software. The very first time you publish a website, it will take about 10 minutes or more to upload it. After that, any changes you make will be instantaneous. The GUI for Github is also fairly simple and all it takes to upload/edit pages is a few clicks.<p>
